## 🛠 Structural Refactoring: From Script to Engine
Today I moved away from a basic diagnostic script toward a modular architecture. I realized that keeping "debug" code mixed with "simulation" code was creating technical debt and making the project feel abstract.

* **Modularization:** Decided to keep `find_dipper.py` as a diagnostic utility and created `src/simulation.py` as the core engine.
* **Functional Design:** Implemented the `project_stellar_motion` function. This allows the same logic to handle past, present, and future states by simply changing the `years` parameter.

## 🧮 Physics & Kinematics Implementation
I successfully bridged the gap between the project README and the source code by implementing the 3D-to-2D projection math.

* **Z-Axis Integration:** Incorporated **Radial Velocity (rv)** to update stellar distance. Since the Big Dipper stars show negative radial velocity, the simulation correctly models them moving closer to Earth over the next 50,000 years.
* **Unit Translation:** Established constants for unit conversion:
    * `mas_to_deg`: Translating milliarcseconds to degrees for celestial mapping.
    * `km_s_to_pc_yr`: Converting velocity into Parsecs-per-year to maintain distance scale integrity.


## ✅ Session 4.0 Status
* **Code:** `src/simulation.py` is operational and verified.
* **Verification:** Manual check of **Merak** confirmed a distance decrease over +50k years, validating the radial velocity math.
* **Architecture:** The project is now structured to support a "Dashboard" layer (Jupyter) for future visualization.

**Next Step:** Perform a "Shear Analysis" to calculate how many degrees of separation the Big Dipper's "Bowl" stars undergo versus the "Handle" stars.
