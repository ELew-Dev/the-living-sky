## 🚀 The Pivot: Perspective & Professionalism

### **Defining the Reference Frame**
I spent time today clarifying the physics of the project. I realized that "The Sky" is a relative term. 
* **The Reality:** The view of the Big Dipper only exists because of where we sit in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way.
* **The Fix:** I updated the project objective to define a **Geocentric (Earth-centered) perspective**. This keeps the math focused on what we see from our backyard. It's a small detail, but it makes the simulation scientifically accurate.

### **The "Inverse-Square Law" Refresher**
I started looking into how I'm going to handle the stars moving closer or further away (Radial Velocity). 
* **The Concept:** I learned (or re-learned) the **Inverse-Square Law**. Basically, if a star moves twice as far away, it gets four times dimmer. 

## 🛠 Repository & Profile Architecture

### **Data Hygiene**
I officially finalized the `.gitignore` setup. 
* **The Logic:** I’ve labeled the `/data` folder as **"Ignored by Git."** It’s a professional move—I’m keeping the 15MB CSV on my Mac and only pushing my logic to GitHub. It keeps the repo lightweight and shows I know how to manage large datasets.

## ✅ Session 3.0 Status
* **README:** Updated with technical specs, the J2000 baseline, and the temporal scope (+/- 50k years).
* **Code:** The "Checkpoints" script is pushed and verified.
* **Logs:** Session 1 and 2 are consolidated; Session 3 is documented.

## 🔭 Sesh 3.1: Expanding the Z-Axis (3D Vectoring)
* **Status:** `src/find_dipper.py` ran successfully. The initial version focused on the 2D sky map (`ra`, `dec`) and side-to-side speed (Proper Motion: `pmra`, `pmdec`).
* **The Goal:** I need to identify the depth variables to apply the **Inverse-Square Law**. This requires knowing the starting distance and how fast they are moving away or toward us.
* **The Update:** Modified the script to extract `dist` (distance in parsecs) and `rv` (radial velocity in km/s).
* **The Observation:** Looking at the `rv` column, every single number is **negative**. 
    * **The Realization:** This means they are all hurtling toward Earth, which implies they should appear brighter in the simulation as time progresses.
* **The Finding:** **Dubhe** and **Alkaid** have negative `pmra` values while the others are positive. 
    * **Conclusion:** This confirms that the Big Dipper isn’t a single object; it’s a group of stars moving on different trajectories that only look like a single pattern from our current perspective.
* **Status:** Changes pushed to GitHub.

## 🛠 Sesh 3.2: Architecture for `project_motion`
I’m currently planning the logic to factor in time changes from the present to 50k years in the future or 50k years in the past.

* **DEFINE:** I need to create a function called `project_motion(df, years)`.
* **INPUT:** Insert the Big Dipper data and the number of years.
* **CALCULATION:** $(\text{Proper Motion} \times \text{Time})$.
* **OUTPUT:** New Coordinates.

### **Technical Deep Dive: Why Pandas?**
* **The Dataframe (`df`):** This is the core object of the Pandas library. The rows contain individual stars, while columns store names, coordinates, and velocities.
* **ESSENTIAL:** Without a `df`, if you wanted to change 100,000 stars, there would need to be a loop written that would change it one by one. 
* **Vectorization:** If I write `df['ra'] + 10`, Pandas will update all 100k rows at the exact same time. This is the difference between a script that hangs and one that actually works.

### **⚠️ Implementation Note**
When writing the `project_motion` function, I have to remember that `pmra` in the HYG database is usually in **milliarcseconds per year ($mas/yr$)**, but the `ra` (Right Ascension) is in **decimal degrees**. I need to factor in this unit conversion so the stars don't fly off the map.

## ✅ Session 3.2 Status
* **In Progress:** Writing the `project_motion(df, years)` function that will allow the data to be changed dynamically based on the specific timeframe provided.
