# 📔 Engineering Journal: Session 3.0
**Date:** February 4, 2026  
**Lead Developer:** Ethan Lewis

## 🚀 The Pivot: Perspective & Professionalism

### **Defining the Reference Frame**
I spent time today clarifying the physics of the project. I realized that "The Sky" is a relative term. 
* **The Reality:** The view of the Big Dipper only exists because of where we sit in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way.
* **The Fix:** I updated the project objective to define a **Geocentric (Earth-centered) perspective**. This keeps the math focused on what we see from our backyard. It's a small detail, but it makes the simulation scientifically accurate.

### **The "Inverse-Square Law" Refresher**
I started looking into how I'm going to handle the stars moving closer or further away (Radial Velocity). 
* **The Concept:** I learned (or re-learned) the **Inverse-Square Law**. Basically, if a star moves twice as far away, it gets four times dimmer. 

## 🛠 Repository & Profile Architecture

### **Data Hygiene**
I officially finalized the `.gitignore` setup. 
* **The Logic:** I’ve labeled the `/data` folder as **"Ignored by Git."** It’s a professional move—I’m keeping the 15MB CSV on my Mac and only pushing my logic to GitHub. It keeps the repo lightweight and shows I know how to manage large datasets.

### **Profile Alignment**
I updated my main GitHub profile to better reflect who I am and what I’m doing. 
* **The Narrative:** I shifted away from "I like exploring" to a more professional tone: "Software Engineer and Data Specialist focused on complex systems." 
* **Education Integration:** I added my **M.S. in Computer Science (Candidate)** at Merrimack. It’s important the contedxt explains the Software Engineering principles I’m applying to this astronomy project. It bridges the gap between my independent research and my formal training.

## ✅ Session 3.0 Status
* **README:** Updated with technical specs, the J2000 baseline, and the temporal scope (+/- 50k years).
* **Code:** The "Checkpoints" script is pushed and verified.
* **Logs:** Session 1 and 2 are consolidated; Session 3 is documented.

**Next Step:** Start the kinematic math script to move the Big Dipper 50,000 years into the future.
