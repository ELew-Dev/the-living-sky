# 📔 Engineering Log: The Living Sky

### **Sesh 1.0 - 1.1: Scoping & Environment Setup**
* **Research:** Spent 12:30 PM – 4:30 PM pinning down the project scope. Decided on a stellar motion simulation ("The Living Sky"). 
* **The "Clean Room" (VENV):** Set up a Virtual Environment to isolate dependencies.
    * **The Logic:** Without a `venv`, libraries like `Pandas` install globally. Keeping them in a local "room" ensures the main system stays clean. 
    * **Refresher:** Realized that setting up from scratch takes more focus than it used to. Documentation is key to avoiding backtracking.

### **Sesh 1.2: The "Git Tangle" Post-Mortem**
Ran into a conflict where the local repo and GitHub had unrelated histories due to an auto-generated LICENSE file on GitHub.
* **The Problems:** 1. Branch names didn't match (`master` vs `main`).
    2. Git tried to "track" unrelated projects on my desktop during a messy pull.
* **The Fix:** 1. Wiped the local history (`rm -rf .git`).
    2. Re-initialized and forced the branch name to `main`.
    3. Used a `--force` push to establish my local files as the Source of Truth.

### **Sesh 2.0: Data Ingestion & Guardrails**
* **Stack:** `pip install pandas matplotlib astropy`.
* **Acquisition:** Switched to the **HYG Database (v4.1)** after the first source returned a 404 error. 
* **Architecture:** Updated `.gitignore` to block the 15MB CSV from being pushed. 
    * **Reasoning:** GitHub is for source code (logic), not raw data storage. Externalizing data keeps the repo lightweight.
* **Verification:** Confirmed data accuracy by finding **Sol** (the Sun) at coordinates `0,0,0`.

### **Sesh 2.1: Troubleshooting the "Silent Fail"**
The filtering script ran but returned zero results with no error messages.
* **The Debug:** Implemented a checkpoint system to verify:
    1. File path existence.
    2. Row count (Confirmed 119,626 rows loaded).
    3. String sanitization (Used `.str.strip()` to handle hidden spaces in star names).
* **Result:** Successfully isolated 7/7 stars for the Big Dipper.

### **Technical Concepts Mastered**
* **2D Projection:** Calculating how 3D stellar movement appears on a flat celestial sphere.
* **Proper Motion:** Using `pmRA` and `pmDec` (side-to-side/up-and-down velocity) to predict future coordinates.
* **Radial Flux:** Understanding how a star's brightness changes based on its distance over time.
* **Secular Timescales:** Modeling drift over 50,000+ year windows.
